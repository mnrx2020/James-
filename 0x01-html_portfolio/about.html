<h1 id="About">About</h1>
<p id="About">Who Am I? I am a Software Developer from Nairobi, Kenya. I have spent the last 3 years in an 
artificial intelligence sector as an instructor, training 3D projects and monitoring the throughput and output.
I have always had a knack for technology and working with computer programs. In February, 2022 I started learning 
software engineering. I started learning C, Git&Github

Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn to learn more. I dived into html, css and javascript 
and was even more enthused with making websites interactive. I am now spending my time learning 
Javascript and building projects, very optimistic acquiring technical skills in Reactjs, nodejs,Expressjs,SQL, AWS and python.
My mission is to be a fullstack developer.</p>
